# Fixed-point problems in Wasserstein space

Various statistical tasks, such as  sampling or computing Wasserstein barycenters, can be reformulated as fixed-point problems for operators on probability distributions. 
The goal is to accelerate the fixed-point iterations with Riemannian Anderson mixing.
